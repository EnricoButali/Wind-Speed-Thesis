## Title

**Full (frontespizio):**
Continuous-Time Modelling of Wind Speed for Derivatives Pricing and Risk Management

**Short (running header / slides):**
Continuous-Time Wind-Speed Modelling for Pricing and Risk Management

*Approved by supervisor (3-chapter structure). She noted the title is slightly
long; the short version is the trimmed form. An alternative that foregrounds the
instrument, if preferred: "Continuous-Time Wind-Speed Modelling for Variance-Swap
Pricing and Risk Management".*

---

## Global decisions (apply throughout)

**Structure:** 3 chapters (approved). Conclusions are the closing section of
Chapter 3, not a standalone chapter.

**Deliverable cadence:** draft and send to the supervisor **one complete chapter
at a time**.

**Datasets and their roles:**
- **Dataset A** — OpenWeatherMap, Bologna, Italy, 10 m, 2015–2018 (4 yr,
  1,462 daily obs). Role: **proxy** on which the methodology is built and
  validated. Low-wind site (mean ≈ 2.47 m/s).
- **Dataset B** — Open-Meteo ERA5 reanalysis, Nordfriesland, Germany, 100 m hub
  height, 2015–2024 (10 yr, ≈ 3,652 daily obs). Role: **reference / main result**,
  geographically aligned with SMARD generation and EEX power markets. All headline
  empirical claims rest on Dataset B.
- **SMARD generation + EEX day-ahead prices** (Germany, 2015–2024) enter in the
  pricing/risk chapter.

**Citation style:** author–year (Harvard/APA-like), via `natbib`
(`\citet` / `\citep`). Chosen because (a) it is the Dept. of Statistical Sciences /
quantitative-finance norm and (b) the existing chapters are already written in it,
so the phase chapters merge without re-keying. The programme does not mandate a
specific style — confirm with supervisor if she expresses a preference.

---

## Editorial rules (from the official GrEnFIn "writing and grading" page — mandatory)

- **Font:** Times, Courier, or Helvetica → set the thesis in **Times**
  (`newtxtext` + `newtxmath`, or `mathptmx`). If existing chapter preambles use
  Latin Modern / Computer Modern, switch to Times for the merged document.
- **Page density (Italian *cartella* spec):** 32–35 lines per page, 65–70
  characters per line. ⇒ ≈ 2,200 characters ≈ **~370 words per page**.
  Planning yardstick: a ~70–90 page main text ≈ 26,000–33,000 words.
- **Printing:** double-sided (fronte/retro) is mandatory.
- **Figures/tables:** UNI A4/A3 format; numbered progressively; table/figure notes
  at the foot of the table/figure, not the page.
- **Frontespizio:** follow the official University title-page + trademark/logo template.

**Grading criteria to write toward** (thesis discussion adds 0–6 points to the
starting grade): originality of topic · methodological correctness · level of
detail · quality of writing/drafting · presentation. Our originality hook is the
Value-of-Information / aligned-data argument; methodological correctness is
protected by the frozen anchors and the framing rules below.

---

## Framing rules / landmines (non-negotiable — carried from the RAship)

1. **θ = 0** is "adopted as a benchmark assumption in the absence of EEX
   option-implied data." Never "θ = 0 is standard" or "the market price of risk is
   zero." Under this benchmark P = Q and Track B reduces to `K_var = h × C0`.
2. **Carr & Lee (2009)** = theoretical motivation for variance-swap replication
   **only**. The implemented formula is **Tol (1997)** `K_var^B = h × C0`. Never
   title an implemented section "Carr-Lee." *(There is an offending section title
   in the Dataset B Phase 6 `.tex` — see NB below.)*
3. **1.931× height correction** `((100/10)^(2/7))` appears **only** in the
   Value-of-Information comparison (Ch 3), nowhere else.
4. **Track A vs Track B units:** Track A = 252×-annualised realised variance;
   Track B = `h × C0`, left un-annualised. Their numeric gap is a **units
   convention**, not model error. State this explicitly wherever they are compared.
5. **Frozen anchors** (Box–Cox λ, AR/CAR/GARCH coefficients, NIG params, RMSE, VoI
   percentages, Feller margins, etc.) are fixed, validated results. Quote them;
   do not re-derive.

**Notation (fix once, in a nomenclature list; match existing chapters):**
`W̃(t)`, `Λ(t)`, `σ̃²(t)`, `h(t)`, `CAR(4)`, matrix `A`, `exp(Aτ)`, `K_var^A`,
`K_var^B`, `C0`. Do not introduce new symbols for existing objects.

# Chapter structure (3 chapters)

Status tags used below:
- **[READY]** — draftable now from committed material.
- **[CREATE]** — blocked until a missing chapter is written from the notebook.
- **[EXPAND]** — a compact `.tex` exists but must be built to full depth.

---

## Chapter 1 — Introduction, Literature Review and Data  (~18–22 pp) — [READY]

**1.1 Motivation and background.** Wind as a non-tradable, weather-driven
underlying; joint volumetric and price risk for German wind producers; the case for
weather/energy derivatives; economic stakes (≈100 MW farm, ≈€50 M annual revenue —
framed from the Phase 7 synthesis). Nordfriesland = densest German onshore corridor;
EEX German power options are Europe's most liquid.
*Sources:* `CLAUDE.md` (dataset motivation); PH7_A / PH7_B syntheses; ROADMAP objectives.

**1.2 Research questions and contribution.**
- RQ1: can a CAR(4)+GARCH continuous-time framework, calibrated on aligned
  hub-height data, price a synthetic wind variance swap?
- RQ2: what is the Value of Information from upgrading a geographic proxy
  (Bologna 10 m) to an aligned reference (Nordfriesland 100 m)?
- RQ3: how effective is the CAWS instrument as a left-tail hedge?
Contribution: methodology built and validated on A, applied on B; explicit VoI
quantification; CAWS construction.

## Chapter 2 — Methodology and Empirical Wind-Speed Modelling  (~35–40 pp, core)

Method and results interleaved, phase by phase (P1–P5). Both datasets, **Dataset B
primary**; each subsection presents A and B side by side.

**2.1 Deseasonalisation & transformation** (Phase 1) — Box–Cox λ, Fourier seasonal
mean Λ(t), seasonal variance σ̃²(t), standardised W̃(t). Results: Weibull (k,c), λ,
variance-modulation %. — [READY]
*Sources:* PH1_A (PDF), PH1_B (`.tex`); phase-1 figures.

**2.2 Conditional mean — AR(4)** (Phase 2) — PACF cutoff at lag 4, OLS, link to the
continuous-time OU/CAR representation. Results: β₁…β₄, RMSE vs persistence
(A: 0.6017 vs 0.6856 ≈ 12.2 %), long-memory verdict. — [READY]
*Sources:* `ar4_coefficients.csv`, `ar4_residuals_phase2.csv`; PH2_A, PH2_B.

**2.3 Conditional volatility — GARCH(1,1)** (Phase 3) — two-component
σ²_total = σ̃²·h. Results: ω, α, β, persistence α+β, half-life, A-vs-B comparison,
standardised-residual diagnostics. — [READY]
*Sources:* `garch_parameters_phase3.csv`; PH3_A, PH3_B.

**2.4 Continuous-time embedding — CAR(4)** (Phase 4) — companion matrix A,
exp(Aτ), conditional moments under P, NIG tails, Fourier seasonal variance. Results:
eigenvalues & stationarity, conditional-forecast term structure, NIG α̂/δ̂,
Samuelson-effect violation for p>1. — [READY]
*Sources:* `car4_parameters_phase4.csv`, `car4_matrix_A_phase4.csv`,
`car4_eigenvalues_phase4.csv`, `car4_conditional_forecast_phase4.csv`;
PH4_B (`.tex`). *(PH4_A is PDF-only — draw the A column from the PDF + CSVs.)*

**2.5 Stochastic-volatility framework** (Phase 5) — Heston/CIR two-SDE embedding,
Feller condition, characteristic function / Riccati system, **θ=0 benchmark**, why
MLE is deferred to hourly data. Results: Feller margin (A 27.9×, B 28.1×),
round-trip consistency (max|Δ| = 4.44e−16), variance term structure (piecewise-h vs
Heston/CAR(1)).
- Dataset B column — [READY] (`reference_tex/Phase_5/PH5_Analysis.tex`).
- **Dataset A column — [CREATE]** (see NB): write `benchmark_latex/phase5` from
  `benchmark_notebooks/phase5/PHASE_5.ipynb`.
*Framing watchpoints:* θ=0 wording; MLE-deferral rationale.

## Chapter 3 — Derivatives Pricing, Risk Management and Conclusions  (~25–30 pp, headline)

**3.1 The synthetic wind variance swap** (Phase 6) — instrument definition;
Track A empirical strike (252 × rolling realised variance from SMARD); Track B model
strike `K_var^B = h × C0` across four h-scenarios (h_t0, h_winter, h_summer, h=1);
unit reconciliation via delta-method `(9/W̄²)`; power-curve linkage G ∝ W³ (OLS R²,
constant c); merit-order effect (negative G–P correlation, pre/post-2018 robustness);
payoff fan / 10-year simulation.
- Dataset A — [READY] (`benchmark_latex/phase6/PHASE_6_Analysis.tex`).
- **Dataset B — [EXPAND]** (see NB) + **retitle the "Carr-Lee" section**.
*Sources:* `variance_swap_phase6.csv`, `variance_swap_summary_phase6.csv`,
`smard_daily_phase6.csv`; phase-6 figures.

**3.2 Cross-dataset forecast validation** (Phase 7) — Diebold–Mariano
(Harvey–Leybourne–Newbold small-sample correction); GARCH volatility diagnostics
(Ljung–Box, ARCH-LM); forecast-error distribution (Normal vs NIG, Jarque–Bera).
- Dataset A — [READY]; **Dataset B — [EXPAND]**.
*Sources:* `phase7_A_dm_results.csv`, `phase7_B_dm_results.csv`; phase-7 figures.

**3.3 Value of Information** (Phase 7) — K_var^B_A ≈ 0.054 vs K_var^B_B ≈ 0.874;
93.8 % raw mispricing; 88 % after height correction (**1.931× factor only here**);
finding: geographic mismatch (Bologna's ≈8.8× lower C0) dominates the error, not
model misspecification; economic magnitude.
- Dataset A — [READY]; **Dataset B — [EXPAND]**.
*Sources:* `phase7_A_voi_table.csv`, `phase7_B_voi_table.csv`.
*Three landmines concentrate here: 1.931× scope, θ=0, Track A/B units.*

**3.4 Risk management — CAWS hedging** (Phase 7) — K_CAWS; distribution metrics on
**non-overlapping annual** observations (A: 4 obs 2015–2018; B: 10 obs 2015–2024) to
avoid overlapping-window bias; CVaR₅% (A ≈ −0.121 m/s; B from CSV); left-tail
histogram; Sharpe; delta sensitivity ∂K_var^B/∂h = C0 and the h = 2×h_t0 stress
scenario.
- Dataset A — [READY]; **Dataset B — [EXPAND]**.
*Sources:* `phase7_A_hedging_summary.csv`, `phase7_B_hedging_summary.csv`;
`germany_wind.csv` / `data.csv` (CAWS series).

**3.5 Conclusions.** Summary (forecast hierarchy validated — AR(4) reliable one-step
benchmark, CAR(4) preserves accuracy while enabling pricing; GARCH(1,1) sufficient;
geographic mismatch dominates pricing error; A→B upgrade economically justified).
Limitations (θ=0 benchmark; daily-frequency non-identification of SV params; proxy
nature of A; SMARD national aggregation vs single grid point). Future work (EEX
option-implied θ + full Carr–Lee replication; ECMWF/ERA5 hourly SV estimation;
NIG/Lévy-driven pricing). Implications for producers/risk managers. — [READY] as
skeleton; finalise once 3.1–3.4 Dataset B is expanded.

# NB — LaTeX chapters to CREATE / EXPAND from the RAship workflow

The RAship produced 14 phase documents (7 phases × 2 datasets). Most are complete;
**three writing jobs** remain, and they are the critical path. Do these in the
LaTeX style of the existing phase chapters (graybox / litbox / darkblue-midblue),
now switched to the Times / cartella editorial spec above.

1. **CREATE — Dataset A, Phase 5.** `benchmark_latex/phase5/` is empty (only a
   `.gitkeep`); no `.tex`, no PDF. Write it from
   `benchmark_notebooks/phase5/PHASE_5.ipynb`. Anchors already exist (Feller 27.9×,
   CIR κ_V=0.0165, v̄=0.608, ξ²≈4.8e−5). → unblocks **Ch 2 §2.5 Dataset A column**.
   *This is the only true void.*

2. **EXPAND — Dataset B, Phase 6.** `reference_tex/Phase_6/PHASE_6_Analysis.tex`
   is a compact draft (~220 lines vs 297–425 for sibling B chapters). Build it to
   full depth. **Also retitle** the section currently named
   "Carr-Lee Variance Swap Framework (Dataset B)" → e.g. "Synthetic Wind Variance
   Swap Framework (Dataset B)" (framing rule 2). Notebook + CSVs are present.
   → unblocks **Ch 3 §3.1 Dataset B**.

3. **EXPAND — Dataset B, Phase 7.** `reference_tex/Phase_7/PHASE_7_Analysis.tex`
   is a compact draft (~244 lines). Build to full depth. CSVs present
   (`phase7_B_dm_results.csv`, `_voi_table.csv`, `_hedging_summary.csv`).
   → unblocks **Ch 3 §§3.2–3.4 Dataset B**.

**Also note:** Dataset A Phases 1–4 exist only as **compiled PDFs** (no `.tex`
committed in `benchmark_latex/phase1..4`). When writing the Dataset A columns of
Ch 2, draw content from those PDFs + the CSVs. Dataset A Phases 6–7 have full `.tex`.

**Sequencing:** Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 §§2.1–2.4 are fully unblocked → draft first.
Only §2.5 (A) is gated by job 1. Chapter 3's Dataset B half is gated by jobs 2–3.
Recommended order: **Chapter 1 → job 1 (create A-Phase 5) → Chapter 2 →
jobs 2–3 (expand B-Phase 6/7) → Chapter 3.**

# NB — Bibliography cleanup

- **Benth & Šaltytė Benth (2009)** — *Dynamic pricing of wind futures*, Energy
  Economics **31**, 16–24. The file is named "Benth (2008)" (submission year); the
  **published year is 2009** → cite as 2009. This is the core CAR(4)/Euler /
  Samuelson-effect reference. Present in `papers/`.
- The existing chapters cite this paper under **two duplicate BibTeX keys**
  (`SaltyteBenth2009` and `BenthSaltyteBenth2009`) → merge into one key.
- Fix a stray author initial ("Šaltytė Benth, **A.**" → "**J.**" for Jūratė).
- A separate **Šaltytė Benth & Benth (2008)** temperature paper (*Stochastic
  modelling of temperature variations…*, Applied Mathematical Finance 15) is cited
  in the bib but is **not physically in `papers/`** → either source the PDF or drop
  the citation. Decide before finalising Chapter 1.
